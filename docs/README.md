SlipStream v4 Documentation
===========================

This directory contains the high-level documentation for SlipStream
v4.  Autogenerated API documentation does **not** appear here.

Viewing Website Locally
-----------------------

To setup your local machine for development, you must first install
the full ruby development environment. After that run the following
commands from this directory:  

```sh
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
 bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ""
```

You can then navigate to http://localhost:4000 to see the generated
website.  This is updated automatically when changes are made to the
sources.

Updating GitHub Pages
---------------------

Changes pushed to the master branch will trigger an update of the
[SlipStream v4 GitHub Pages](https://slipstream.github.io/ssv4/).
