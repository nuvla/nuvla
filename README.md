# Nuvla

The Nuvla platform allows you to manage your container-based
applications on multiple infrastructures, including those on the edge.

This repository contains the core documentation for the platform:

 - [Nuvla Platform Guides](https://nuvla.github.io/nuvla/)

The code for the platform can be found in the other repositories
within the Nuvla organization on GitHub.
